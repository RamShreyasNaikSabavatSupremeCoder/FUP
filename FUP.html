                A project by Ram Shreyas Naik Sabavat 5/16/22 
                    <br> 
                Gregor the Overlander: By Suzanne Collins (Author and Illustrator)

            <h2>
                Summary
            </h2>
            <p>
                A 10 year old kid wanted to just have a normal life and his dad back from his disappearance.
                <br>But after dropping into the Underland, Gregor and his sister Boots (Margret) needed to get out of there and save his dad, because Gregor thinks his dad fell into the same air vent. 
                <br>So, he made new Underlander friends, followed the prophecy of gray, and saved his dad. 
                <br>Then he bonded with Ares, a bat/flier, to get Gregor and his sister and dad out of the Underland. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Symbolism
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The rats - the antagonists - sybolises of being a problem to the main character. 
                    <br>Some rats are very dirty and smelly, because they live in the Dark Land, where animals and people get thrown away if they get guilty from the court. 
                    <br>And also we think of them of pests, because they just are weird to us humans. 
                    <br>I think the theme is to always avoid things that are unuseful to your journey. 
                    <br>If you follow the theme, you should never have trouble completing something. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The colorful theme of Regalia - the color of the main city/kingdom - symbolises joy in the city theme and people. 
                    <br>This theme can be applied anywhere, for example in Los Angles: it is very dirty there due to air pollution.
                    <br>And L.A. can be very dirty with trash, garbage, and air and/or land pollution.
                    <br>L.A. can be dark or scary using that theme.
                    <br>If you follow the theme, you should know if a place is really light or dark
