                        Summary
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        A 10 year old kid wanted to just have a normal life and his dad back from his disappearance.
                        <br>But after dropping into the Underland, Gregor and his sister Boots (Margret) needed to get out of there and save his dad, because Gregor thinks his dad fell into the same air vent. 
                        <br>So, he made new Underlander friends, followed the prophecy of gray, and saved his dad. 
                        <br>Then he bonded with Ares, a bat/flier, to get Gregor and his sister and dad out of the Underland. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Symbolism
                    </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The rats - the antagonists - sybolises of being a problem to the main character. 
                            <br>Some rats are very dirty and smelly, because they live in the Dark Land, where animals and people get thrown away if they get guilty from the court. 
                            <br>And also we think of them of pests, because they just are weird to us humans. 
                            <br>I think the theme is to always avoid things that are unuseful to your journey. 
                            <br>If you follow the theme, you should never have trouble completing something. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The colorful theme of Regalia - the color of the main city/kingdom - symbolises joy in the city theme and people. 
                            <br>This theme can be applied anywhere, for example in Los Angles: it is very dirty there due to air pollution.
                            <br>And L.A. can be very dirty with trash, garbage, and air and/or land pollution.
                            <br>L.A. can be dark or scary using that theme.
                            <br>If you follow the theme, you should know if a place is really light or dark

                    <li>
                        One metaphorical dragon is that when Vikus told Gregor that he was a warrior, Gregor did not believe that. 
                        <br>He told Vikus what he thought in his head and now he is getting bombarded with Vikus saying that he is a warrior.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another metaphorical dragon that Gregor faced is when he tried to escape, which caused Luxa and her friends to come and protect Gregor from the rats that appeared. 
                        <br>But after the "mini-battle" Luxa's parents died. 
                        <br>So she slaps Gregor because she thinks it is his fault.

                    Theme
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think that the theme is to never give up, even in hard times.
                    <br>When Gregor was declared as a warrior, Vikus said that he would have to be the one who saves Regalia from the future of the Prophecy of Gray. 
                    <br>He also hd to struggle in the feelings of what his mother was thinking when her husband and her 2 kids are gone. 
                    <br>He had to also set lots of goals while he was the warrior to make sure he comes back to the Overland quickly. 
                    <br>Lastly, he is anyway the main character of the book, which means that he has a high chance of going through a fantasy-like adventure during the book.

                <p>
                    I reccomend this book to advanced 3rd graders and up, but overall the theme of the of the book is applicable for all ages.
                    <br>First of all, the theme is very clear in the book. The theme can be applied anywheere.
                    <br>Second of all, the plot line of the story is not messed up. The elements of the story are all neatly organized.
                    <br>And lastly, the symbolism and the dragons in the story were clear and helped the story flow.
